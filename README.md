Welcome to Retheraphy Project ! (https://final-project-retheraphy.vercel.app/)

Retheraphy is a mobile application that helps people to track their mental health conditions by answering 6 questions. Also, the app will suggest the better practices to maintain healthy mental conditions and teach symptoms that may cuase serious mental health issues. Our goal is to let people being aware of their mental health conditions and let them check their conditions regulary.

Since it is mental health tracking application, we selected the colors that make people feel calm and confortable, such as light greens and pinks. Also we picked sans-serif font for optimizing the readability and user-friendliness.

The most challenging part of this project was collecting the 6 answers from the users and calculating their mental health level scores to display on the result page. We appraoched it by giving the numbers to each answer and accumlated the total numbers to scale the mental health level.
